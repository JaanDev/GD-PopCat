## How to
1. Go to Releases or compile it by yourself -> get the dll
2. Copy all the files from the Assets folder in this repository to GD "Resources" folder
3. Open Geometry Dash
4. Inject the dll into GD(using **Cheat Engine** or **GDDLLLoader by adafcaefc** or anything else)
5. Profit!

P.S. You can also use Stud_PE to make it load every time you open GD
1. Download Stud_PE
2. Open libcurl.dll from GD folder(not Resources)
3. Go to the "functions" tab
4. Right-click anywhere you want and choose "Add New Import"
5. Tap "Dll select" and open GD-PopCat.dll
6. Next, press "Select func."
7. Scroll to the very bottom and choose an item called something like ?ZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ
8. Tap "OK" and then "Add to the list"
9. Press "Add"
10. Profit!
